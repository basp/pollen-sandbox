#lang pollen

This is the first paragraph with some inline ◊${\beta = 10} math.

And this should be the second paragraph that contains a little bit of ◊code{3 + 2 = 5} code. Let's make this paragraph a little bit longer and include a bit more of ◊${\beta = 2} so it starts to wrap to multiple lines. That way we can see if the line height settings are nice.

◊$${
    \begin{align}
    1234_{10} &= 1\cdot1000 + 2\cdot100 + 3\cdot10 + 4\\
              &= 1\cdot10^3 + 2\cdot10^2 + 3\cdot10 + 4
    \end{align}
}

Now this one should be the third paragraph but I'm not really sure how it will be rendered by Pollen though.
